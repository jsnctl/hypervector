**Status: ðŸ”¨ Pre-first release**

Hypervector is a test data fixture engine intended for data-intensive production systems such as those reliant
on machine learning and data science components. It makes configuring & generating high dimensional feature 
vector fixtures for testing easy and repeatable.

## Use

Hypervector sits naturally alongside your integration and smoke test infrastructure
during continuous integration stages, and makes large high-dimensional feature vectors
available via endpoint.

The service allows for benchmarks to be saved alongside their parent feature vectors. These can be 
asserted by test runners  via the Hypervector API, providing a sophisticated regression testing framework for
statistical properties of your fixtures.
