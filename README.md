**Status: 🔨 Pre-first release**

Hypervector is a test data fixture engine intended for data-intensive production systems such as those reliant
on machine learning and data science components.

It makes configuring & generating high dimensional feature vectors easy, and provides data populations for testing
deterministically over HTTP. Output from your function under test can also be hashed and stored for future assertion to
detect specific regressions related to input data sub-populations.

## Use

Hypervector naturally sits alongside your integration and smoke test infrastructure
during continuous integration stages, and makes large high-dimensional feature vectors
available via endpoint.

The service allows for benchmarks to be saved alongside feature vectors which can be 
asserted by test runners to provide a sophisticated regression testing framework for
statistical properties of your fixtures.

## Build

You can run the test suite and build a local binary (useful for development) with:

```bash
make all
```

Building and running a Docker image is done with:

```bash
make docker
```
